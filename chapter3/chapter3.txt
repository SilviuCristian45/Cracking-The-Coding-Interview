Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks 
 ________________________________________________________________
 pg 111 3 2 How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element?
 Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time

 pg 115 3 4 In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods and N disks of different sizes 
 which can slide onto any tower   The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom 
 (e g , each disk sits on top of an even larger one)  You have the following constraints: (A) Only one disk can be moved 
 at a time (B) A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod (C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger 
 disk Write a program to move the disks from the first rod to the last using Stacks

 pg 118 3 5 Implement a MyQueue class which implements a 
 queue using two stacks 
 ________________________________________________________________
 
 pg 120 3 6 Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order 
 You should not make any assumptions about how the stack is implemented  
 The following are the only functions that should be used to write this program: push | pop | peek | isEmpty
